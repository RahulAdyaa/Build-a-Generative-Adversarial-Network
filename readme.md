Build a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from scratch using PyTorch. It is built on the MNIST dataset to generate synthetic handwritten digits. The goal of this project is to understand and implement the basic architecture and principles of GANs, including the generator and discriminator networks, loss functions, and optimization processes.

Project Overview
The GAN consists of two neural networks:

Generator (G): Takes random noise as input and generates images.
Discriminator (D): Distinguishes between real and fake images (real images from the MNIST dataset vs. fake images generated by the generator).
The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive process, where the generator aims to improve at creating realistic images, and the discriminator aims to better distinguish real images from generated ones.

Dataset
This project uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The images are pre-processed with random rotations for data augmentation.

Project Structure
Training Loop: The GAN is trained for 10 epochs, where both the generator and discriminator are updated at each step.
Generator and Discriminator Architecture: The generator uses deconvolution layers (ConvTranspose2d), and the discriminator uses convolutional layers (Conv2d).
Loss Functions: Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) is used for both real and fake image loss.
Optimization: Adam optimizer with learning rate and beta values.
Training

for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Training steps for both discriminator and generator
    ...
The training loop updates both the discriminator and the generator.
Loss is calculated for both the real and fake images, and gradients are backpropagated accordingly.
Results
After training, the generator creates realistic handwritten digits, which can be visualized as follows:

python
Copy
Edit
noise = torch.randn(batch_size, noise_dim, device=device)
generated_image = G(noise)
show_tensor_images(generated_image)
Results Visualization
The show_tensor_images() function visualizes batches of images, allowing you to observe how the generator improves over time in generating synthetic handwritten digits.

Future Improvements
Increase the number of epochs for better image quality.
Experiment with different GAN architectures (e.g., DCGAN, WGAN).
Implement additional techniques such as batch normalization, label smoothing, etc.
