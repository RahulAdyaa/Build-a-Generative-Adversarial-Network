# Build a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from scratch using PyTorch. It is built on the MNIST dataset to generate synthetic handwritten digits. The goal of this project is to understand and implement the basic architecture and principles of GANs, including the generator and discriminator networks, loss functions, and optimization processes.

## Project Overview
The GAN consists of two neural networks:

- **Generator (G)**: Takes random noise as input and generates images.
- **Discriminator (D)**: Distinguishes between real and fake images (real images from the MNIST dataset vs. fake images generated by the generator).

The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive process, where the generator aims to improve at creating realistic images, and the discriminator aims to better distinguish real images from generated ones.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
